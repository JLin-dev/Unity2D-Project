Traveler: Excuse me, where is this.[w]

Village Head: You're in Minghu Village, a declining village. It's been a long time since we've had any young folks here, sigh...[w]

Traveler: What happened?[w]

Village Head: This used to be a peaceful little village, known for its slime liquor. But one day, strange toxic slimes appeared. They not only attacked people but also infected the regular slimes[w].

Village Head: The ingredients for slime liquor started running short, and some even fell ill after drinking it. The villagers gradually left, leaving only me, this stubborn old man.[w]

Traveler: My aircraft is broken. Do you have any parts to help me repair it?[w]

Village Head: Head east from here. There's an abandoned factory where they once researched increasing slime production. You might find various tools there to craft the parts you need.[w]

Traveler: Alright, thank you.[w]
